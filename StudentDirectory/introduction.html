        <h5>STILL LIFE STUDY<br><br></h5>
        <p class="intro">
          In Still Life Study, students are required to draw and shade or paint a group of objects which could be man-made or natural.<br><br>
          It may include things such as cut flowers, fruits, vegetables, a growing plant, as well as domestic or other artificial
          objects of daily use. The discipline develops and sharpens observation as well as drawing skills, gradually enabling the
          student to depict the group of objects in realistic form, proportions and perspective, as well as to capture the light and
          shade, the surface texture and the material qualities of the objects.<br><br>
          The students’ eyes are trained to ‘see’ the beauty in ordinary objects and capture it on paper in their artwork. They
          develop their visual faculty to estimate proportions, sizes and appearances accurately, learning how to use different
          techniques and mediums of shading and painting. <br><br>
          Above all, the students learn to capture the soul of a composition, infusing their work with inspiration and beauty,
          by developing a command over their medium of choice and capturing an artistic vision in their art.

      <h5>APPLIED ART<br><br></h5>
      <p class="intro">
      Applied Art is an introduction to graphic design. Students learn to design book covers, posters, invitation and greeting cards, repeat patterns and logos. The art of Calligraphy and Typography are important components of design, and hence, an introduction to both of these is an integral part of the content.
      <br><br>
      The emphasis is on developing a sound understanding of composition, visual communication and presentation skills. The young designers are made to understand the role of art in enabling better communication of an idea, information or a product. It is a broad subject area that combines awareness of consumer needs and tastes with the ability to catch their attention and achieve a defined purpose.
